# AsyncWorldEditBossBar

This is a boss bar API for AsyncWorldEdit on Spigot 1.15+

https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/asyncworldedit-boss-bar.76600/

Most APIs I found were out of date so I made my own

# Installation

Install the jar (obtained from compiling) as you would any other plugin.
It will automatically generate its config and attach its self to AWE
